        <!-- Sub-Heading -->
        <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3" id="BlogSubHeading">About Animal Planet (Not the channel)</h4>
        <p class="blog-content" id="BlogContent"><b>Animal Planet</b> refers to undomesticated animal species, but has
            come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife
            was also synonymous to game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. Wildlife can be found in
            all ecosystems. Deserts, plains, grasslands, woodlands, forests, and other areas including the most
            developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers
            to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by
            human activities. Some wildlife threaten human safety, health, property and quality of life. However, many
            wild animals, even the dangerous ones, have value to human beings. This value might be economic,
            educational, or emotional in nature.</p>
            <p>
            Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways, including the
            legal, social and moral senses. Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. This includes
            such animals as feral cats, dogs, mice, and rats. Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and
            in modern times, concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the
            exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.
            </p>
            <p>
            Global wildlife populations have decreased by 68% since 1970 as a result of human activity, particularly
            overconsumption, population growth, and intensive farming, according to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund's Living
            Planet Report and the Zoological Society of London's Living Planet Index measure, which is further evidence
            that humans have unleashed a sixth mass extinction event.[3][4] According to CITES, it has been estimated
            that annually the international wildlife trade amounts to billions of dollars and it affects hundreds of
            millions of animal and plant specimen.</p>
